                    <p>
                        Do you need a facility for a loved one in Muncie, Indiana?  Care Strategies can help
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In 2018, the entrepreneurial pair of Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva achieved their longstanding dream of owning and operating a facility that provides long-term residential care to individuals with intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain injuries and physical disabilities. They had the opportunity to enter the marketplace with the advent of Care Strategies by purchasing a small facility in Muncie, Indiana: Brookside Care Strategies. With that purchase, Ron and Jamey were able to incorporate all their services, completing their vision by providing therapy, staffing and the latest technology in one location.

                    <p>
                        Patient satisfaction and quality health care is at the forefront of any Strategies undertaking and this has never been more evident than at Brookside Care.  After owning this 42 bed building in Muncie for just under two years, the owners of Care Strategies have worked diligently to remodel the physical facility and convert all patient charting to electronic records.  Brookside Care Strategies lives by their mission “to enrich the lives of loved ones by providing a caring, compassionate and safe home environment” for our residents.
