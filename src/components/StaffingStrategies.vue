                  <h2>We are "Staffing Strategies"</h2>

                  <p>Staffing Strategies was born out of a need for supplemental staff for our sister company, Rehab
Strategies. We first established a solid therapy/nursing pool with a reputation for quality and reliability.
We then began selectively offering our services to other facilities with the same high-quality standards.
Our promise to our client is that we would never place a therapist or nurse in their facility that we would
not place in our own Rehab Strategies or Care Strategies facilities.</p>
