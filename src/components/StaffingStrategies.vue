                    <p>
                        In response to the industry high demand for qualified, temporary therapists and nurses, Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva opened Staffing Strategies in 2010. After managing their own supplemental staff at Rehab Strategies, they used that experience and applied it toward opening the next phase of The Strategies enterprise.                  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our facilities and partners now benefit from Staffing Strategies’ ability to alleviate significant gaps in their therapy coverage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a reliable, on-call roster of physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and specifically trained assistants. Our staff can be assigned to a facility for coverage lasting as short as a few hours to concurrent weeks lasting as long as the facility needs. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2018, after such an overwhelming response from facilities needing open shift replacements, Staffing Strategies added nurses to our stable of staffing professionals.  We deliver day, evening and overnight shift coverage.  Many of the nurses will provide double shift coverage when needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Scheduling personnel is a constant strain for all healthcare facilities.  Let Staffing Strategies be the one to relieve your stress by utilizing their therapists and available nurses. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At times, all healthcare facilities find themselves short staffed.  By utilizing consistent replacement coverage through Staffing Strategies, neither patients nor healthcare providers will experience a lapse in quality care. Staffing Strategies is here for you; let us be the one you call to fill your scheduling void.  
                    </p>
