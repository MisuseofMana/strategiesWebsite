                            The Strategies is the culmination of over 30 years of healthcare experience, strategic initiatives to identify necessary gap coverage, and fast-paced entrepreneurial expansion. It consists of four interconnected healthcare companies formed and brought to fruition by Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva. With the vision to be a leader in the industry and an easily identifiable name and logo, The Strategies strives to meet and exceed the needs of our partners by identifying and closing gaps in healthcare. The empty circle in the middle of The Strategies’ logo represents the hole our customers need help filling and the dots represent the many strategies we offer that will help fill those gaps.

                        Staffing Strategies was developed in 2010 in response to the significant gaps in therapy staffing our partners were experiencing. To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a roster of PT’s, OT’s and ST’s with a reputation of exceptional work and reliability.  In 2018, Staffing Strategies added another deliverable to our partnerships. In response to their requests, nurses were added to our stable of staffing professionals.

                        In 2018, the entrepreneurial pair achieved their longstanding dream of owning and operating a facility that provides long term residential care. They had the opportunity to enter the marketplace with the advent of Care Strategies by purchasing a small facility in Muncie, Indiana: Brookside Care Strategies. With that purchase, they were able to incorporate all their services, completing their vision by providing therapy, staffing and the latest technology in one location.

                        With technology developing at lightning pace, Ron and Jamey quickly identified a need for advanced equipment to optimize the performance and testing of patients receiving therapy services.  With that idea in mind, Innovative Treatment Strategies (ITS) was born in 2013.  ITS brings the latest technology to our clients at a reasonable cost and with therapists that are knowledgeable in both the use and efficacy of the equipment. This includes their exclusive product, The MR Cube.
